to "POOR's (universal) LCD interface V1.4b" by Andrea Bonzini

1 - added function LCD_CUSTOMCHAR to customize the character in
    the CGRAM. 

2 - added new settings for entry mode:
	LCD_CURSOR_VISIBLE (enable/disable the cursor)
	LCD_CURSOR_BLINKING (enable/disable the cursor blinking)
	
3 - added a small routine for typewrite effect. To enable this,
    the flag LCD_TYPEWRITE must be set to 1. The delay between
	characters can be chosed by the option LCD_TW_DELAY (ms).
	This setting enables a delay routine in the LCD_WRITE
	function (only if we're not in command mode).
	
4 - slightly modified the code that defines the rows address
    (the lines 1 and 2 have the same address for all lcd
	types, and then I've putted them out of the #if statement).
	
5 - slightly modified the initialization function. The delays
    are now incremented (the old values could not be efficient
	on some lcds). Added the clear display after diplay off as
	specified on some datasheets.
